In order to use this command, two environment variables must be set: 
    1. ```APIKEY``` : the key of the Cognitive Service
    2. ```REGION``` : the location of the Cognitive Service
- ```npm run build```
Builds the source code and packages it into the ```dist``` folder which then can be served by any server.
- ```npm run lint```
Cleans up the code and the formatting.
